if you wish to contribute within github, you should ideally be familiar with git, the source code management system that tegcommerce uses, with the official repository being hosted on github:
* you can learn more about git here: http://try.github.io/ (there are many tutorials available on the Web)
* you can get help on github here: https://help.github.com/
* windows users can get a nice interface for git by installing tortoisegit: https://tortoisegit.org/

contributors should follow the following process:
1. create your github account, if you do not have one already
2. fork the tegcommerce project to your github account
3. clone your fork to your local machine
4. create a branch in your local clone for your changes
5. change the files in your branch
6. push your changed branch to your fork in your github account
7. create a pull request for your changes on the tegcommerce project
8. wait for one of the core developers either to include your change in the codebase, or to comment on possible improvements you should make to your code

that's it: you have contributed to this open source project! congratulations!

if you don't feel comfortable forking the project or using git, you can also either:
* edit a file directly within github: browse to the target file, click the "edit" button, make your changes in the editor then click on "propose file change". github will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own github account, then suggest to create a pull request to tegcommerce. once the pull request is submitted, you just have to wait for a core developer to answer you

remember if: contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small

thank you for your help in making tegcommerce even better!
